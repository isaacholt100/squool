Squool is designed to be a complete online school system: it has online editable "books" which students can take notes in and which teachers can see, classes which allows teachers to share messages and files with students, a personalised timetable, reminders, as well as a selection of useful tools such as a calculator and a dictionary.

This is a project I started a while ago, without much consideration as to how long it would take me. It was only after I had started working on it for some time and made some significant progress that I realised that building an entire online system for schools to use like this is not something that can be achieved by one person. What I have built so far is semi-functional, in that most of the features have been put in place, but there are many things that need to be done to tie it all together. I have therefore decided that for now I should not continue to develop this as it would realistically never be finished with just me working on it. However, I do think that the idea has potential and if done properly it could be extremely successful. So if anyone has a play around with the website and thinks that it might be worth something, then I am more than happy to accept a pull request on this.
